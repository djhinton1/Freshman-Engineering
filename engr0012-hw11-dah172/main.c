Sometimes it is nice to print out text in \'single quotes\', this requires the single quote escape sequence \\\'. \n\nWant to printout a %% sign, you need to use the escape sequence \"%%%%\", do you understand \nthe code required to print this sequence out\\\? \n\nFinally, notice all the single slashes\'\\\' at the end of each line. These allow you to wrap the printf string to the next line for easy reading. Make a bell ring at this point. \a Did you hear the bell ring\?\n\n");
